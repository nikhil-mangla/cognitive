2. Login / Signup Flow
User clicks “Login” or “Sign Up.”
User authenticates (email/password, OAuth, etc.).
On successful login, the backend generates a secure access token (JWT or similar).
3. Profile Creation / Update
After login, user is prompted to:
Upload their resume (PDF)
Enter job role
Enter company
User submits the profile form.
Backend stores the profile data, associated with the user.
4. Token Handoff to Desktop App
Goal: The website must provide the access token to the Electron app so it can authenticate API requests.
Option A: Download Token File (Simple)
After login/profile completion, the website provides a “Connect to Desktop App” button.
Clicking the button triggers a download of a token.json file:
Apply to Login.tsx
}
User is instructed to place this file in a specific location (or the app can prompt for it).
Option B: Custom Protocol Handler (Seamless)
After login/profile completion, the website redirects to a custom protocol URL:
Apply to Login.tsx
>
The Electron app is registered to handle myapp:// links and saves the token automatically.
Option C: QR Code (Optional)
Website displays a QR code containing the token.
User scans it with the desktop app (if you add QR scanning support).
5. Desktop App Fetches Profile
Once the token is available, the desktop app uses it to call:
Apply to Login.tsx
>
The backend returns the user’s profile (resume, job, company, etc.).
6. User Experience Summary
User logs in/signs up on the website.
User completes their profile.
User connects the desktop app (via file download, protocol, or QR).
Desktop app fetches and uses the profile for personalized features.

Security Considerations
Always use HTTPS for all website and API traffic.
Store tokens securely (never expose in URLs unless using a custom protocol).
Expire tokens as appropriate and allow users to revoke them.
Optional Enhancements
Add a “Connected Devices” section on the website for users to manage/revoke desktop app tokens.
Allow users to update their profile at any time, and sync changes to the app.
